# KittyScanBlocklist
A list of IPs detected to be scanning for minecraft servers.

These IPs are detected by the [KittyScan](https://kittyscan.com) honeypots. This list is updated every 12 hours. Any IPs that have not been detected in the last 14 days will be removed from the list.

**Please note that these IPs should not considered to be malicious. They are (or have been) simply scanning for minecraft servers. _Doing illegal stuff with them is still illegal._**

The [KittyScan](https://kittyscan.com) scanners are not exempt from this list.

> No pull requests will be accepted for this list. Only IPs detected by KittyScan will be added to this list.

The IPs are separated by new lines. `ips-16.txt` and `ips-24.txt` are the same list but as a /16 and /24 subnet respectively.
